DISCLAIMER:
    This was created by one nerd as a passion project to learn python and help someone get a bunch of classes in Google faster than it could be done by hand. If you choose to run this script and something bad happens, I take no responsibility but would like to know for bugfixing. You should probably take a bit of a read through to make sure you feel 

REQUIREMENTS:
    macOS 10.15 or newer (really just python 3.8+ but that ships with 10.15)
    GAM installed, configured, authenticated, and up to date


Usage:
    1. Copy the TEMPLATE csv or create one with columns in the same order as the template (more intelligent column handling will come later)
    2. add CSV(s) to the same directory as the script 
    3. Confirm that each class has at least one teacher (required for Class creation)
    4.
